Student Data WebApp

This is a project for the Kuna High School, Kuna ID Mouse Squad to create a web app that students can use on their computer devices to see their own schedule information and other specific information.

The students are building it with the help of two instructors.

You are welcome to fork this project for your needs, but please don't suggest changes until the app has been completed by the students, we want them to learn how to code on their own.
